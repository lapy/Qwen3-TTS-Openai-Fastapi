"""Apple Silicon MLX backend for Qwen3-TTS.

This backend uses mlx-audio to run Qwen3-TTS natively on Apple Silicon.
The default checkpoint is a CustomVoice model, so the backend uses
``generate_custom_voice`` for non-streaming and the unified ``generate()``
with ``stream=True`` for incremental chunks. The backend reports
``supports_voice_cloning() == False``; the ``clone:ProfileName``
voice-library route therefore falls through to the existing
"voice cloning not supported" error path.
